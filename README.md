## Projects

### [Kubernetes_helm_charts](https://github.com/SHCHERBANV/devops_todolist_kubernetes_task_12_helm_charts/tree/develop)

Deployed a Django-based ToDo list application with a MySQL database in a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts. The setup supports automated scaling, resource management, and monitoring.

Technologies
Django (Python 3.8+): Web framework.
Kubernetes & Kind: Orchestration and local cluster.
Helm: For managing Kubernetes applications.
MySQL: Deployed as a Helm sub-chart.
Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring.
Bash: Automation scripting.

Responsibilities
Cluster Setup: Deployed a Kubernetes cluster with Kind.
Helm Charts: Developed Helm charts for the app and MySQL.
Automation: Scripted automated deployment.
Monitoring: Set up Prometheus and Grafana monitoring.

### [Azure](https://github.com/SHCHERBANV/azure_task_12_deploy_app_with_vm_extention/tree/develop)

This project involves automating the deployment of a ToDo web application on an Azure Virtual Machine using PowerShell and a VM extension. The goal is to deploy a VM, automatically install the web app, and ensure it runs on port 8080 without manual intervention.

Technologies Used
Azure PowerShell (Az Module): For managing Azure resources.
PowerShell 7: Used for scripting VM and app deployment.
VM Extensions: To automate app installation on the VM.
Bash: For the custom installation script.

Responsibilities
Script Development: Wrote a PowerShell script to deploy a VM and install the ToDo app via a custom VM extension.
Automation: Configured VM extension to run a Bash script that clones the app from a GitHub repository.
Deployment: Deployed the application and verified it runs on the VM.

### [ci/cd_pipeline](https://github.com/SHCHERBANV/devops_todolist_cicd_task_6_polish_pipeline/tree/develop)

This project improves the CI/CD pipeline for a Django-based ToDo app by integrating Docker and GitHub Actions. It automates building and pushing Docker images, runs tests across multiple environments, and enforces branch protection with manual approvals for staging deployments.

Technologies Used
Django (Python 3.8+): Web framework.
GitHub Actions: CI/CD automation.
Docker: Containerization and DockerHub integration.
Matrix Builds: Multi-version Python and OS testing.
Responsibilities
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated Docker builds, tests, and deployments.
Matrix Testing: Configured tests for Python 3.8, 3.9 on Ubuntu and Windows.
Branch Protection: Enforced pull requests and status checks.
Manual Approval: Required for staging deployment.


### [Deploying  application with Terraform](https://github.com/SHCHERBANV/devops_todolist_terraform_task/tree/develop)
This task uses Terraform to deploy a Todo List app on an Azure Virtual Machine. It automates provisioning Azure resources like Virtual Network, Subnet, Network Security Group, Public IP, VM, and storage. The VM extension automates the app's installation.

Technologies:
Terraform: For infrastructure as code.
Azure: For hosting resources.
Azure CLI: For managing resources locally.
VM (Ubuntu 22.04): Where the Todo app runs.
Custom Script Extension: To run install-app.sh for app deployment.
Networking: VNet, Subnet, NSG, Public IP for connectivity and security.
Storage: Azure Blob Storage for state management.

Role:
Infrastructure Setup: Provision resources with Terraform.
Modular Design: Build reusable modules for networking, compute, and storage.
App Deployment: Use VM extension to deploy the Todo app.
Remote State: Manage state in Azure Blob Storage.
Testing: Ensure successful deployment and app functionality.
